# Chapter 1: Introduction to Spec-Driven Development

## Goals
- Understand what spec-driven development (SDD) is and why it matters
- Learn the difference between traditional "vibe-coding" and spec-driven approaches
- Recognize the benefits of using specifications as the source of truth
- Get an overview of the workshop structure and learning objectives

## Background Information

### What is Spec-Driven Development?
- **Definition**: SDD is an approach where specifications become living, executable artifacts that drive the entire development process
- **Not waterfall**: SDD is not about exhaustive documentation or trying to predict the future
- **Version control for thinking**: Makes technical decisions explicit, reviewable, and evolvable
- **AI-powered**: Specs become executable with AI agents, turning intent into working code

### The Problem with "Vibe-Coding"
- **Guesswork**: AI agents make reasonable assumptions based on incomplete information
- **Scattered decisions**: Architectural decisions trapped in emails, chats, or someone's head
- **Costly changes**: Discovering misalignments late in development when changes are expensive
- **Code as specification**: When code becomes the de facto spec, it's hard to maintain and evolve

### Why Specs Matter with AI Agents
- **Clear intent**: AI agents excel at pattern recognition but need unambiguous instructions
- **Shared context**: Prevents team members from working with different assumptions
- **Early validation**: Surface assumptions and edge cases before writing code
- **AI steering**: Specifications guide AI agents to build exactly what's needed

### The Four Phases of Spec-Driven Development
1. **Specify**: Define what to build and why (user journeys, experiences, outcomes)
2. **Plan**: Establish how to build it (stack, architecture, constraints)
3. **Tasks**: Break down the work into small, implementable chunks
4. **Implement**: Execute tasks with AI agents handling the heavy lifting

### Benefits of Spec-Driven Development
- **Reduced rework**: Changes cost keystrokes instead of sprints
- **Better onboarding**: New team members understand the "why" behind decisions
- **Multi-variant exploration**: Easy to create different implementations from the same spec
- **Living documentation**: Specs evolve alongside code, never becoming stale

### Workshop Overview
- **Duration**: 60-90 minutes
- **Approach**: Hands-on, step-by-step guide through all four phases
- **Outcome**: Build your first spec-driven project using GitHub Spec Kit
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code and GitHub Spec Kit toolkit
