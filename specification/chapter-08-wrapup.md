## Background Information

### Workshop Recap

#### What We Learned
- **Spec-Driven Development**: A methodology where specifications drive the entire development process
- **The Four Phases**: Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement
- **AI-Powered Development**: How to effectively work with AI coding agents
- **Living Documentation**: Specs as evolving, executable artifacts
- **Quality Through Structure**: How process improves outcomes

#### Key Takeaways
1. **Specs are executable with AI**: Not just documentation, but the source of truth
2. **Separate "what" from "how"**: Specification defines what, plan defines how
3. **Small tasks = better results**: AI agents excel with focused, discrete work
4. **Validate at each phase**: Don't skip ahead without reviewing
5. **Iterate and refine**: First draft is rarely perfect
6. **Constitution matters**: Establish principles upfront
7. **Your role is steering**: AI implements, you guide and validate

### The Spec-Driven Development Workflow Review

#### Phase 1: Specify
- **Input**: Project idea, user needs
- **Process**: Use `/specify` to generate specification
- **Output**: Detailed spec focused on user journeys and outcomes
- **Key question**: "What should we build and why?"

#### Phase 2: Plan
- **Input**: Completed specification
- **Process**: Use `/plan` to generate technical plan
- **Output**: Technical architecture, stack, and implementation strategy
- **Key question**: "How should we build it?"

#### Phase 3: Tasks
- **Input**: Specification and plan
- **Process**: Use `/tasks` to break down into implementable pieces
- **Output**: Detailed task list with acceptance criteria
- **Key question**: "What specific work needs to be done?"

#### Phase 4: Implement
- **Input**: Task list
- **Process**: AI agent implements tasks one by one
- **Output**: Working, tested code that fulfills the specification
- **Key question**: "Does this implementation meet our requirements?"

### What Makes SDD Different

#### Compared to Traditional Development
- **Traditional**: Requirements → Design → Code → Test → Deploy
- **SDD**: Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement (with AI)
- **Key difference**: Specifications are executable with AI agents

#### Compared to "Vibe Coding"
- **Vibe Coding**: Describe goal → Get code → Hope it works
- **SDD**: Structured phases → Validated artifacts → Predictable results
- **Key difference**: Explicit validation checkpoints

#### Compared to Waterfall
- **Waterfall**: Rigid, linear, no changes
- **SDD**: Flexible, iterative, specs evolve
- **Key difference**: Living documents vs. frozen requirements

### Practical Applications

#### When to Use SDD
- **Greenfield projects**: Starting from scratch
- **Feature additions**: Adding to existing systems
- **Legacy modernization**: Rebuilding old systems
- **Learning new technologies**: Structured exploration
- **Team collaboration**: Shared understanding

#### When SDD Might Be Overkill
- **Trivial changes**: One-line bug fixes
- **Prototypes**: Quick throwaway experiments
- **Well-understood patterns**: Repetitive boilerplate

### Your SDD Journey Continues

#### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Practice the workflow**: Build a small project using all four phases
2. **Customize templates**: Adjust templates to your needs
3. **Build your constitution**: Define your personal/team principles
4. **Experiment with prompts**: Find what works for your style
5. **Share your experience**: Teach others what you learned

#### Building SDD Habits
- **Start small**: Apply to personal projects first
- **Track improvements**: Note quality and speed gains
- **Iterate on process**: Adjust workflow as you learn
- **Build a library**: Save successful specs and plans
- **Reflect regularly**: What's working? What could improve?

#### Scaling to Team/Organization
1. **Pilot with team**: Small project with willing teammates
2. **Document learnings**: What works in your context?
3. **Create shared resources**: Team constitution, templates
4. **Train others**: Run internal workshops
5. **Establish standards**: Formalize SDD as team practice
6. **Measure impact**: Track quality, speed, satisfaction metrics
