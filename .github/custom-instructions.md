This is a workshop for using Githubs spec kit toolkit. It is an addition to our Github Copilot program for the GH-300 Github Copilot certification. Before we had a context engineering workshop, but that is currently outdated when you look at spec-driven development.

Resources to use:
- https://developer.microsoft.com/blog/spec-driven-development-spec-kit
- https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/spec-driven-development-with-ai-get-started-with-a-new-open-source-toolkit/
- https://github.com/github/spec-kit

The workshop should be roughly 60-90 minutes long and should provide the participants all the stages to spec-driven development in step-by-step chapters giving background information and help them to build their first spec-driven project setting up their environment. They can choose their own topic or subject for the application, but it is nice to provide some simple suggestions.

I want to use Vitepress to enrich the Markdown files and publish to a Github page.

Tech stack for workshop:
- Github spec-kit toolkit
- Visual Studio code
