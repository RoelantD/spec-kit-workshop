# Chapter 7: Best Practices & Advanced Topics

You've learned the core workflow of spec-driven development. Now let's explore best practices, common pitfalls to avoid, and advanced techniques that will make you more effective.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- ✅ Learn best practices for each phase of SDD
- ✅ Understand common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- ✅ Explore advanced SDD patterns
- ✅ Discover tips for team collaboration
- ✅ Learn how to scale SDD to larger projects

---

## Best Practices by Phase

### Phase 1: Specification Best Practices

#### 🎯 Focus on User Outcomes

**Do:**
```markdown
Success Metric: Users complete 20% more tasks per week
User Experience: App feels instant (< 100ms response time)
```

**Don't:**
```markdown
Technical Goal: Achieve 99.9% uptime
Implementation Detail: Use Redis for caching
```

#### 📝 Capture the "Why"

Always document motivation:

```markdown
## Feature: Offline Support

WHY: Developers often work in places with spotty internet (trains,
planes, coffee shops). They need to capture tasks even offline.
Without offline support, they'll lose thoughts or switch to paper/notes.
```

#### 🧪 Use Concrete Examples

Abstract requirements are confusing. Use examples:

**Vague:**
```markdown
Users can manage task priorities.
```

**Concrete:**
```markdown
Users can manage favorite cities:
- Example: Click "Add to Favorites" saves current city
- Example: Favorites list shows max 10 cities
- Example: Click any favorite loads that city's weather immediately
- Example: Remove button deletes a city from favorites
```

#### 🚫 Stay Technology-Agnostic

**Wrong:**
```markdown
The React app will show tasks in a Material-UI table.
```

**Right:**
```markdown
Users see tasks in a scannable, sortable list format with:
- Task description
- Priority indicator
- Time since creation
```

---

### Phase 2: Planning Best Practices

#### 💡 Right-Size Your Architecture

::: warning Beware Over-Engineering
A CLI tool doesn't need microservices.  
A prototype doesn't need a CDN.  
Start simple, scale when needed.
:::

**Scale-appropriate architecture:**
- **Small tool**: Single file or simple modules
- **Small app**: 3-tier architecture (UI, Logic, Data)
- **Medium app**: Layered architecture with clear boundaries
- **Large app**: Microservices, event-driven, etc.

#### 📋 Document Decisions

Use **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**:

```markdown
# ADR-001: Use localStorage for Client Data

## Context
Need to persist user preferences and favorite cities. Options: localStorage, 
IndexedDB, server-side database.

## Decision
Use browser localStorage for client-side data persistence

## Rationale
- Simple: No backend/database setup required
- Persistent: Data survives page refreshes
- Synchronous: Easy to work with in vanilla JS
- Sufficient: Expected < 100 KB of data
- Cross-browser: Widely supported

## Consequences
- Limited to ~5-10 MB storage
- Data is per-browser (not synced across devices)
- No query capabilities
- If we need more, can migrate to IndexedDB or add backend

## Status
Accepted - 2026-02-11
```

#### 🔒 Security from Day One

Don't add security as an afterthought:

```markdown
## Security Plan (Include in Every Plan)

### Input Validation
- Validate all user input
- Sanitize for script injection
- Limit input lengths

### Data Protection
- File permissions (user-only read/write)
- No plaintext secrets
- Secure temporary files

### Dependencies
- Pin versions
- Regular security updates
- Scan with safety/snyk
```

#### ✅ Plan for Testing Early

```markdown
## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (70% of effort if applicable)
- Core business logic functions
- Target: 80% coverage
- Framework: Vitest (for Vite projects)

### Integration Tests (20% of effort)
- Full user workflows
- API integration
- localStorage interactions

### Manual Tests (10% of effort)
- User experience
- Visual testing
- Cross-browser compatibility
```
- User experience
- Cross-platform verification
```

---

### Phase 3: Tasks Best Practices

#### 🔨 Keep Tasks Atomic

**One task, one job:**

❌ **Too broad:**
```markdown
TASK-010: Implement Weather Features
- Fetch weather data
- Display current weather
- Show forecast
- Handle favorites
```

✅ **Properly scoped:**
```markdown
TASK-010: Implement Current Weather Display
TASK-011: Implement 5-Day Forecast Display
TASK-012: Implement Favorite Cities List
TASK-013: Implement Add to Favorites Feature
```

#### 📏 Use Consistent Sizing

All tasks should be similar size:
- **Small**: 30min - 1 hour
- **Medium**: 1-2 hours
- **Large**: 2-3 hours

If a task is > 3 hours, break it down.

#### ✓ Write Testable Acceptance Criteria

**Vague:**
```markdown
- [ ] Code works
- [ ] No bugs
```

**Specific:**
```markdown
- [ ] `fetchWeather()` returns weather object with required fields
- [ ] Invalid city name throws appropriate error
- [ ] API key is read from environment variables
- [ ] Response includes temperature, humidity, wind speed
- [ ] Function handles network errors gracefully
```

#### 🔗 Identify Dependencies Explicitly

```markdown
TASK-015: Implement Forecast Display Component

Dependencies:
- TASK-002: Weather API Service (needs API integration)
- TASK-010: Current Weather Display (similar UI patterns)

Blocked by: TASK-002
Blocks: TASK-020 (integration tests need this component)
```

---

### Phase 4: Implementation Best Practices

#### 🧹 Maintain Code Quality

**Use automated tools:**

```powershell
# Format code
npm run format

# Linting
npm run lint

# Type checking (if using TypeScript)
npm run type-check

# Run all quality checks
npm run lint && npm run format && npm run build
```

#### 🎯 Implement One Task at a Time

**Sequential workflow:**
```
TASK-001 [complete ✓] → TASK-002 [complete ✓] → TASK-003 [active 🔄]
```

**Why:**
- Clear focus
- Immediate validation
- Easier debugging
- Predictable progress

#### 🤖 Trust but Verify

AI-generated code needs review:

```python
# AI generates this - looks good?
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

# YOU catch the issue:
def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b
```

**Always:**
- Run the code
- Read the code
- Test edge cases
- Check security

#### 💾 Commit Frequently

```powershell
# After each task completion
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement TASK-XXX"

# Small logical chunks
git add src/components/weatherDisplay.js
git commit -m "feat: add weather display component"

git add src/services/weatherApi.js
git commit -m "feat: add weather API service"
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Skipping the Spec

**Problem:**
```
You: "I know what I want, let's just start coding!"
[2 weeks later]
You: "Wait, why did I build it this way?"
```

**Solution:**
Always write a spec first, even for "simple" features. It takes 15 minutes and saves hours.

---

### Pitfall 2: Specs Too Technical

**Problem:**
```markdown
# Specification (WRONG)

The system will use a PostgreSQL database with a tasks table
containing columns id, description, priority_id...
```

**Solution:**
```markdown
# Specification (RIGHT)

Users need to track tasks with:
- Description of what to do
- Priority level (high/medium/low)
- Status (active or completed)

Tasks must persist between sessions.
```

Save the database choice for the plan!

---

### Pitfall 3: Plans Without Justification

**Problem:**
```markdown
Technology Stack: Go with Gin framework
```
Why Go? Why Gin? No explanation.

**Solution:**
```markdown
Technology Stack: Go with Gin framework

Rationale:
- Go: Team has Go expertise; excellent CLI support; fast startup
- Gin: Most popular Go web framework; good documentation; active community
- Alternatives considered: Python (slower startup), Rust (steeper learning curve)
```

---

### Pitfall 4: Tasks Too Large

**Problem:**
```markdown
TASK-005: Build the entire API layer (Estimated: 3 days)
```

**Solution:**
Break into smaller tasks:
```markdown
TASK-005: Create API router structure (1 hour)
TASK-006: Implement POST /tasks endpoint (1.5 hours)
TASK-007: Implement GET /tasks endpoint (1.5 hours)
TASK-008: Implement DELETE /tasks/:id endpoint (1 hour)
...
```

---

### Pitfall 5: Not Validating at Each Phase

**Problem:**
- Rush through /speckit.specify → /speckit.plan → /speckit.tasks
- Start implementation
- Realize spec was wrong
- Rework everything

**Solution:**
STOP and validate after each phase:
- After /speckit.specify: Review spec thoroughly, get feedback
- After /speckit.plan: Verify architecture makes sense
- After /speckit.tasks: Check all plan aspects are covered

---

### Pitfall 6: Ignoring the Constitution

**Problem:**
Constitution says "All code must have tests"  
→ You skip tests to move faster  
→ Bugs accumulate  
→ Refactoring becomes scary

**Solution:**
Treat constitution as non-negotiable. If you can't follow it, update it—but be intentional.

---

### Pitfall 7: AI Over-Reliance

**Problem:**
You accept every AI suggestion without thinking.

**Solution:**
AI is a tool, not an oracle. You must:
- Review all code
- Understand what it does
- Verify it's correct
- Ensure it's maintainable

**Remember:** You're signing off on this code!

---

### Pitfall 8: Premature Optimization

**Problem:**
```
Spec: "Commands should feel fast"
Plan: "Implement Redis caching, CDN, worker queues..."
```

**Solution:**
Build the simplest thing first:
```
v1: Simple in-memory cache
→ Measure performance
→ Is it fast enough? Done!
→ Still slow? Now optimize with data.
```

---

## Advanced Topics

### Multi-Variant Implementations

Create multiple implementations from one spec:

```
/speckit.plan

Create TWO technical plans for the Weather Dashboard spec:

PLAN A: Vanilla JavaScript + Vite (primary implementation)
- Quick to build
- No framework overhead
- Easy to maintain
- Fast development

PLAN B: React + TypeScript (alternative)
- Component reusability
- Attractive terminal UI
- Learning opportunity

Compare trade-offs.
```

**Use cases:**
- Evaluate technology choices
- Performance comparison
- Learning new technologies
- Risk mitigation

---

### Legacy System Modernization

Use SDD to modernize old code:

**Step 1: Document Existing Behavior**
```
/speckit.specify

Document what the existing [legacy system] does:
[describe current behavior, warts and all]

Include:
- Current user workflows
- Known issues and limitations
- Features users actually use vs. ignore
```

**Step 2: Plan Modern Replacement**
```
/speckit.plan

Create a modern technical plan that:
- Preserves essential functionality
- Fixes known issues
- Uses modern technologies
- Improves user experience
```

**Step 3: Incremental Migration**
```
/speckit.tasks

Create a migration task list that:
- Starts with standalone features
- Preserves data compatibility
- Allows gradual rollout
- Provides rollback options
```

---

### Spec-Driven Refactoring

Apply SDD to existing projects:

```
/speckit.specify

Document the current state of [component]:
- What it does now
- What problems exist
- What the ideal behavior would be

Create a specification for the refactored version.
```

Then plan and implement the refactoring systematically.

---

### Team Collaboration

#### Shared Specifications

**One spec = one source of truth**

```markdown
specs/
├── user-auth-spec.md          ← Alice owns
├── task-management-spec.md    ← Bob owns
├── api-integration-spec.md    ← Charlie owns
└── README.md                  ← Links between specs
```

#### Distributed Implementation

**Different team members, same process:**

- **Alice**: Implements tasks 1-5 (auth layer)
- **Bob**: Implements tasks 6-10 (business logic)
- **Charlie**: Implements tasks 11-15 (API layer)

All following the same spec and plan!

#### Code Review Against Spec

**In pull requests:**

```markdown
## PR: Implement User Authentication

**Implements**: TASK-003 through TASK-007

**Specification**: specs/user-auth-spec.md

**Acceptance Criteria Checklist**:
- [x] Users can register with email/password
- [x] Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- [x] Registration validates email format
- [x] Tests achieve 85% coverage
- [x] All security requirements met
```

Reviewers check against spec, not just code style.

---

### Scaling to Large Projects

#### Modular Specifications

Large projects need multiple specs:

```
specs/
├── 00-system-overview.md          ← High-level
├── 01-user-management/
│   ├── spec.md
│   ├── plan.md
│   └── tasks.md
├── 02-task-management/
│   ├── spec.md
│   ├── plan.md
│   └── tasks.md
└── 03-reporting/
    ├── spec.md
    ├── plan.md
    └── tasks.md
```

#### Cross-References

Link related specs:

```markdown
## Dependencies

This specification depends on:
- [User Management Spec](../01-user-management/spec.md) 
  for authentication
- [API Gateway Plan](../00-infrastructure/api-plan.md)
  for request routing
```

#### Version Control

Specs evolve—track changes:

```powershell
git log specs/user-auth-spec.md

# View spec at specific time
git show v1.0.0:specs/user-auth-spec.md
```

---

## Measuring Success

### Quality Metrics

**Test Coverage (if using Vitest):**
```powershell
npm test -- --coverage

Coverage: 87%
```

**Code Quality:**
```powershell
# Linting
npm run lint
All checks passed ✓

# Type checking (if using TypeScript)
npm run type-check
No errors found

# Build verification
npm run build
Build completed successfully
```

**Defect Rate:**
- Bugs per feature
- Regressions per release
- Issues opened vs. closed

### Productivity Metrics

**Time to Implement:**
- Specification to working code
- Compare before/after SDD

**Rework Rate:**
- How often do you re-implement?
- With good specs: < 10% rework
- Without specs: 30-50% rework

**Review Efficiency:**
- Time spent in code review
- Spec-driven code reviewed faster

### Developer Experience

**Onboarding Time:**
- New team member to first contribution
- With specs: Days instead of weeks

**Context Switching:**
- Time to remember what you were doing
- Specs provide quick context refresh

**Confidence:**
- How confident are you the code is right?
- Specs + tests = high confidence
